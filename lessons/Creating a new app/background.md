To define a new app, we have to create a new Angular module. An app can consist of more than one module, but often apps end up with only one module. Think of a module as a container where you specify all your configuration, set up routing and register Angular objects like controllers, services, directives, and filters.

###Module syntax
In order to create a module, we call the `module` function of the `angular` object. The `angular` object is made available by referencing the Angular library, so make sure that you only create a module after you have referenced the Angular library in the html markup of your page.

When we create a new module by calling the `module` function, we specify a name for the module as the first parameter, and an array of dependencies for the second parameter.

In the following code, we specify `ourApp` as the name for the module, and an empty array for the dependencies.

####Creating our module
    var app = angular.module('ourApp', []);
    
You can now access the module via the variable `app`.
You could also use the module getter Syntax to retrieve the module at any time:

####Getting our module
    angular.module('ourApp')
    
If you do not specify an array at the end angularJS will return the module instead of creating it.

You don't strictly need to assign it to a variable, a lot of developers don't. It's just done this way to make the code easier to follow during this course.


Try out the syntax for yourself.
